# Mimic_Versions
All versions of Mimic.

Mimic V1.0:
Complete version of program. I added all the features I wanted to add and was comfortable calling it V_1.0.

Mimic V1.1:
Fixed all the bugs I came across when testing the program. The main bugs were with resetting the timer seconds value, the Edit window refreshing, and the main window Delete One button. When refreshing a line that was previously deleted would return. Fixed all these. No new bugs discovered.
